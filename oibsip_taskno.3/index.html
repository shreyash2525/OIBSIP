        <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
        <p>Lionel Messi was born on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina. He began playing football at a young age and

            On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and
            Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[473][474] Messi was
            directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player
            of the tournament for his performances.
            In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals appearance at Lusail
            Stadium. Messi scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the
            last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in each round of a single World Cup edition.
            Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice.
